# Fail if a change modifies, renames or deletes a migration file that already existed at BASE.
# sqlx records a checksum of every applied migration, so editing one — even a comment or a license
# header — makes every existing database refuse to start ("migration N was previously applied but has
# been modified"). New migrations (added files) are fine; fix mistakes with a NEW migration.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-migrations-immutable.sh <base-commit>
#   CI passes the pull request's base sha, or the push's previous head. Skips (exit 0) when the base
#   is empty/unknown (first push of a branch), so it can never block for lack of history.
